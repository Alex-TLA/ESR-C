Docker container is derived from:
    https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker

Run project:
    a. build Jenkins Docker
        $ docker build -t jenkins-docker .
    b. run docker with correct options:
        $ docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -u root -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v ~/ESR-C/jenkins-home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins
    c. open Jenkins page in browser and click on "Scan Repository Now" in the ESR-C-build job (security is deactivated for this example project)
        -> The branch should be discovered and built. After this the build is run every 30 minutes and you can use parameters. The checkout of the ESR-C repo takes some time, since there are          no GitHu Credentials in the container (Quota for anonymous users)


        ! A massive workaround is used to be able to run docker inside of docker:
            - running Jenkin as root to be able to access /var/run/docker.sock -> not secure
                (adding to user group and setting group ID of host ID did not work -> Need to investigate)
            - mounting /var/run/docker.sock to run container on host system and not nested 
    
Requirements:
    a. Setup a Jenkins running inside a Docker container that 
        can spawn docker slaves to run the jobs. 
    b. Setup a job on Jenkins using declarative or scripted 
        pipelines with following requirements: 

        RQ01: Keep job history only for the last 10 jobs. 
        RQ02 Add two parameters: 
            - boolean printName 
            - string  name 
        RQ03: Configure the "Throttle builds" option to only run 2 times each hour. 
        RQ04: Schedule it to run every 30 minutes 
        RQ05: on the in a docker container pre-configured on Jenkins. 
        RQ06: Clone two open source repositories of your choice. 
        RQ07: Add one or two build steps to list the contents of the two folders and save them to a text file. 
        RQ08: Add another build step that should check if the variable printName is checked and print the name. 
        RQ09: Archive the text file. 
        RQ10: Clean the workspace when the job is done. 

Unfulfilled Requirement:
RQ03: I could find no proper solution to achieve this. It seems like there is nothing available at the moment.
